# PROJECT-2: Data Modelling with Apache Cassandra

## Overview

This is a Udacity [Data Engineering](https://www.udacity.com/course/data-engineer-nanodegree--nd027 "Data Engineering") project for handling the data generated by the fictional music streaming comany called Sparkify.:

* **./event_data**: Simulated activity logs for the streaming app e.g. who listened to what song and with which client

Project builds an ETL pipeline (Extract, Transform, Load) to create the database and related tables, fetch data from CSV files, process the data (combine data), and insert the the data back into database. Technologies used are - Python, Apache Cassandra DB.

## About Database

Sparkify event database (called here sparkifydb) schema answers the first set of customer questions:

* _"What artist and song was listened during certain session?"_,
* _"What was the artist, song and user during certain session?"_",
* _"What users have listened certain song?"_

### Tables

* **music_by_sessionid_itemsinsession**: songs and artists in a session (session_id, item_in_session, artist, song, length)
* **music_by_userid_sessionid**: artist, song, and user in a session (user_id, session_id, artist, song, item_in_session, first_name, last_name)
* **music_by_song**: user listening certain song (song, user_id, first_name, last_name)

## How to use?
**Project has following files **

* **event_data**: Folder containing all the event logs data
* **Project_1B_Project.ipynb**: Jupyter Notebook for interactive development using Python to see the intermediary results as well as to perform the core ETL. 
* **event_datafile_new.csv**: Intermediary flat file generated following through the steps mentioned in the Jupyter notebook containing the essential columns required for data analysis.

## Summary

Project-2 provides customer startup Sparkify tools to analyse their service data and help them answer their key business questions like _"What artist and song was listened during certain session?"_, _"What was the artist, song and user during certain session?"_, or _"What users have listened to certain song?"_.
